An end-to-end **Power BI Business Intelligence project** built using the **Brazilian E-commerce (Olist) Dataset**. This dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights by analyzing customer behavior, sales performance, payment trends, and delivery efficiency.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Businesses generate large volumes of transaction data every day, but raw data alone does not support decision-making.

This project consolidates data from **Sales, Payments, and Delivery** tables into a unified Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to:

* Monitor revenue and order performance
* Understand customer purchasing behavior
* Identify top-performing product categories
* Track payment failures and refund risks
* Measure delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction
* Make faster, data-driven business decisions

**Dataset Source:** Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset

## 🎯 Business Objective

To build an interactive self-service analytics dashboard that helps business users answer critical questions such as:

* How much revenue are we generating?
* Which customers contribute the most revenue?
* Which product categories drive sales?
* Are deliveries meeting promised timelines?
* How much revenue is being lost through failed or refunded payments?
* How effectively are we acquiring new customers?

The dashboard eliminates manual reporting and provides instant access to key business metrics.
